# Number-Guessing-Game-Using-Python
I tried a simple python project called "The Number Guessing Game" invites players to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. Players receive feedback on whether their guesses are too high or too low, and the game tracks the number of attempts. After guessing the correct number, players can choose to play again or exit.
